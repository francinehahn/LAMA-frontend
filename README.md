# Labenu Music Awards (LAMA)

This is a React project that simulates a website that manages a music festival lasting three days. The bands start playing at 8am and finish at 11pm. There are two different types of user roles: ADMIN and NORMAL. Only ADMIN users can register bands and concerts, update concerts and ticket prices, create new tickets and photos, and delete photos.
